# Macroplan

A week-by-week plan that keeps the receipts on what a team promised to deliver — a simpler cousin of a Gantt chart whose point is not just scheduling but learning from _how our estimates held up over time_.

Each feature reads left-to-right as a story: where it started, what we first promised, every time it slipped, and when it actually shipped — judged honestly against the **first** estimate, never a moved goalpost.

**Symbols:** `┣` start · `━` continuation · `◯` original estimate (unmet) · `◉` delivered on time · `△` re-estimate (slip) · `▲` delivered late.

## Status

**Feature-complete** against the [design](DESIGN.md) and covered by tests — TOML authoring with live reload, a **library** of named plans, the full week × feature grid render, derived on-time/late classification, milestones, and PNG + `.toml` export all work client-side.

## How it works

- Author a plan as **TOML** in an in-app split editor (re-rendered on every keystroke).
- The view is a **CSS-Grid** week × feature layout with the symbol vocabulary, real status colors (🟢/🟠/🔴 with hover notes), a "now" line, sticky feature-name and week-axis panes, and a trailing **Learning** column.
- On-time vs. late is **derived** by the app against the Original Estimate — you never type "late".
- **Milestones** are vertical lines tied to an explicit list of required features.
- Keep a **library** of named plans in localStorage and switch between them; **export** any plan as a `.toml` file, or the rendered view as a **PNG** to share into Slack or a deck.
- Stack: Vite + Vue 3 + DaisyUI · `smol-toml` (parse) · `html-to-image` (export). Static SPA, no backend.
